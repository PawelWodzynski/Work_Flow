# Project Overview

The project aims to consolidate the knowledge acquired thus far and serve as a platform for experimenting with new concepts and technologies. The primary technologies employed in this endeavor include **Java** as the programming language and **Spring Boot** as the application framework. The choice of databases encompasses both **MariaDB** and **MySQL**.

### Main Application Objectives:

The application, primarily targeted at corporate entities, will begin as a web-based system with plans for a future desktop version. It seeks to offer the following key functionalities:

1. **User Management Panel:**
   - A comprehensive system for managing user roles, permissions, and access levels within the corporate environment.

2. **To-Do List Organization:**
   - Feature-rich task management facilitating efficient organization and tracking of tasks, both collaboratively within teams and individually.

3. **Notebook for Personal Thoughts:**
   - A dedicated space allowing users to record and organize their ideas, notes, and essential thoughts.

4. **Group and Private Chat:**
   - Real-time communication channels supporting both group discussions and private conversations, promoting effective team communication.

5. **Scheduling and Work Hours Management:**
   - A scheduling system aiding in organizing work tasks and monitoring hours worked per month, contributing to better time management and workload distribution.

### Future Development:

These functionalities represent the planned roadmap for the application's features. Their implementation will require patience, as they constitute an extensive set of tools catering to diverse corporate needs. Future iterations will focus on transitioning from the web-based platform to a desktop application.

### Visual Prototype:
A visual prototype of the platform can be previewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/odOdDSgzWptYUJmSC43The/WorkFlow?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=kBviDvh6OBp9ZviP-1). 

This comprehensive suite of features aims to provide a robust and versatile solution for corporate entities, enhancing productivity, collaboration, and organization within the work environment.
